A walkthrough of the Data Analysis Lifecycle, including visualizations. Used in conjunction with US Census data.

Discovery / Requirements

    - I decided to run through the lifecycle and create visualizations off of the total population of people in the United States and China. Time periods included for this cycle should be the beginning of time to now, to see which country had the largest population every year.

Data Collection:

    - I pulled the data directly from a tutorial I went through with CSDOJO. The csv file is inlcuded in my repo, named "countries.csv"

Data-Prep / Cleaning:



Exploration / Planning:

    - After careful consideration, I've decided that the data I've pulled will look best in a simple bar chart. Despite not being the most exciting of visualizations, it certainly accomplishes it's task.

Modeling / Algorithms:

    - I used a line graph which was easier and more understandable for what I was doing.

Automation / Computation:

    - Borrowing key aspects from other labs, and with the help of Google, I constructed the computational means to establish the graph and add the dataset into it.

Review of Findings:
